      <!-- About text -->
      <p>
        Hi y’all! My name is Qamryn, and I am a senior studying Information Science
        with a certificate in Leadership. Outside of academics, I am a member of
        the Wisconsin Cheerleading team, which takes up much of my time during the
        school year. I am also a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., and I
        currently serve as the President of the National Pan-Hellenic Council on campus.
      </p>

      <p>
        I chose to take this class because I am aware of the ongoing lack of
        representation—and frequent misrepresentation—of diverse human groups
        within computer science and technology fields. I wanted to better understand
        why these issues are becoming increasingly important today, how we can work
        to address them beyond simply increasing diversity numbers, and how to
        critically confront my own assumptions about technology and innovation.
      </p>

      <p>
        My favorite “tech” topic right now is learning about Big Data and artificial
        intelligence, particularly their ethical implications, environmental impact,
        integration into daily life and non-technology industries, and the ways they
        are reshaping human thinking and behavior.
